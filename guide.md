# SPARQL and SPARQL Queries!

## What is SPARQL? 
SPARQL (pronounced 'sparkle' :sparkles:) is a query language for the Semantic Web, including Wikidata. Using SPARQL, users can easily search and filter data within an RDF (Resource Description Framework) format to their specifications. It uses much of the same logic as SQL, and is composed using 'triple statements.' This takes the form of subject-predicate-object, where in SPARQL the URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) would be used, and a triple could also be described as entity identifier-attribute name-attribute value. 

## Basic Syntax of a Query

```sql
PREFIX prefix_short_name: <prefix_full_uri>

SELECT ?item
WHERE {
    subject_uri predicate_uri oject_uri.
}
```
